# Spotify to Youtube

I have this big problem. A big TV sitting in my living room. What could be a good use for it when having parties at my place ?

I thought displaying musics videos could be a good idea. Especially because the TV sound is not bad. But Spotify only streams sound to my Apple TV.

So I decided to make a mini-tool to convert Spotify playlists into Youtube playlists. As I'm a singing enthousiast, I also added a karaoke mode.
